## TODO
- [x] add a `debug` option. When enabled, the agent will run in verbose mode, and browser will run in headed mode (doesn't affect configure-browser where browser is always visible).
- [x] Add an `enabled` field to sources.toml to allow enabling/disabling sources.
- [ ] Implement RSS feeds. Add update strategy (e.g. last x days) for RSS feeds.
- [ ] Implement RSS feeds for audio podcasts.
- [ ] Allow adding url lists.
